# designCraft Server (dcServer)

These examples covering coding for dcServer's internal feature set - the focus is on how to code using Java programming language. These features may also be used when coding services or web pages using the Groovy programming language, so learning this is fine, but Groovy will be handled in a document.

Prerequisites for learning to code dcServer.

- familiar with basic coding such as variables, loops, methods/functions and objects
- are comfortable with JSON as presented here <http://json.org/> (if you know JavaScript objects you are 95% there)
- are comfortable with basic XML (if you know HTML5 syntax then you are 90% there, just make sure to end your tags)
- some idea of what a thread is will be helpful, but not critical

## Learning dcServer Steps

For each step run the class referenced and read the source code. (TODO how to run)

1. Example: JSON like data structures - dcraft.example.IntroOne
1. Example: XML handling - dcraft.example.IntroTwo
1. Excercise: Your first dcServer project - setup and code (TODO directions)
1. Example: Function types by reading and running dcraft.example.CallOne
1. Example: Function types by reading and running dcraft.example.CallTwo
1. Example: Function types by reading and running dcraft.example.CallThree
1. Example: Function types by reading and running dcraft.example.CallFour
1. Example: Function types by reading and running dcraft.example.CallFive
