## Files Browser Help

The browser allows you to navigate supplemental files on your server.  These files may be PDFs, Word, Excel, CSV, TXT or image files that you wish to share with the end-users.

It is a good idea to organize files by folders, for example if you are putting meeting notes on the site add a folder called meetings and then upload meeting files to that folder.  In this example if you have a PDF called meeting-May-05-2016.pdf in the folder meetings then the full path to that files would be `/files/meetings/meeting-May-05-2016.pdf`.

For more information on [Upload File](/dcm/edit/files/UploadFile-help) and [Add Folder](/dcm/edit/files/AddFolder-help) visit the links.  Refresh will reload the file listing in case someone else changed the files since you last opened the browser.
