## Edit Image Properties Help

By default this form provides only an entry for Image Description which may be shown along with the image.  However, the web developer must design with descriptions in mind, if you do not see your descriptions after editing this form then contact your developer.

Some galleries add additonal properties to this form, for those galleries you'll need to review the notes specific to the function of that gallery.
