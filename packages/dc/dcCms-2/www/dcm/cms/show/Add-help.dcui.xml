## Add Show Help

A show (or image list) can be defined to create an ordered list of images from this gallery folder.

- Title: The title only shows in the CMS, not to end-users, use a title that is meaningful to site editors.
- Alias: Similar to Title but used internally by the software, must not have spaces or special characters.  For example "`Board-Members`" is acceptable.
- Variation: Which variation should be used when displaying this list.
