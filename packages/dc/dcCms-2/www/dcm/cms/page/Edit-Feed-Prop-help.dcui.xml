## Edit Part Help

Title, Keywords and Description are fields you may wish to edit.  Title is visible in the browser's tab (or title bar) and on print outs from the site.

All three fields may also be used by search engines to help determine page content. You may use SEO terms for these fields.  Note that modern search engines focus more on page content than on the content entered here.

The remaining fields on this page are for informational purposes - who created the page, when it was published, etc.  If you wish the Path to be changed please contact your web developer.
