## Files Chooser Help

The chooser allows you to navigate supplemental files on your server.  These files may be PDFs, Word, Excel, CSV, TXT or image files that you wish to share with the end-users.  Clicking a file will select that file, clicking a folder will open the folder listing.

To link a file you must prepend the path with `/files`, for example if you select a PDF called `meeting-May-05-2016.pdf` in the folder `/meetings` then the full path to that file would be `/files/meetings/meeting-May-05-2016.pdf`.  You shold not have to add `/files` when selecting files from the Chooser, but be aware that it is part of the path.
