Guidance on the size of the photo desired will be provided.  This is for the largest of the photos, sometimes smaller versions of the photo are also required.  These smaller variations will be generated automatically after you upload the file.

Select the file your wish to upload (may say "Choose File" or similar).  Click `Upload` and wait for the progress bar to complete - once progress is complete you'll be returned to the gallery.
